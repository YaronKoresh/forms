Forms design pratice

This is a form design pratice I did to learn red next-gen language, it simply generates VID code from the 
designed form sheet, we save some time in design and locate widgets. Also it allows to paste te code from
the design sheet to its own edit area to permit editing and testing.

Red language is an open source project made by Full Stack Technologies @ www.red-lang.org
