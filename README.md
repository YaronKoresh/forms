Forms design pratice

This is a form design pratice I did to learn Red next-gen language, it simply generates VID code from the 
designed form sheet, we save some time in design and locate widgets. Also it allows to include hand-made 
code from the user, save the whole code and run them.

Red language is an open source project made by Full Stack Technologies @ www.red-lang.org
